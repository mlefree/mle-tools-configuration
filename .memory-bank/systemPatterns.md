# System Patterns: mle-tools-configuration

## System Architecture
The mle-tools-configuration library is built around a core Configuration class and a ConfigurationFactory that manages configuration instances. The architecture follows these principles:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Configuration management is separated from application logic
2. **Centralized Management**: All configuration is managed through a single factory
3. **Domain-Based Organization**: Configuration values are organized by domains for logical grouping
4. **Type Safety**: Generic typing ensures type safety throughout the configuration process
5. **Immutable Core**: Core configuration remains unchanged while allowing for overrides

## Key Technical Decisions

### Generic Typing
The Configuration class uses TypeScript generics (`Configuration<T>`) to provide type safety for configuration values, reducing runtime errors and improving developer experience.

### JSON-Based Storage
Configuration values are stored in memory with JSON serialization capabilities, allowing for easy persistence and transfer of configuration.

### Domain-Based Organization
Configuration is organized by domains, allowing for logical separation of configuration values and easier management of complex configurations.

### Deep Merging
The system implements a deep merging algorithm (via the `Walk` method) that allows for complex nested configuration structures to be merged without losing data.

### Factory Pattern
The ConfigurationFactory pattern is used to create and manage configuration instances, providing a centralized point of access and control.

## Design Patterns

### Factory Pattern
The ConfigurationFactory creates and manages Configuration instances, providing a centralized point for configuration access.

### Builder Pattern
The Configuration class uses a builder pattern (via the `build` method) to construct configuration objects from various sources.

### Facade Pattern
The Configuration class provides a simple interface to complex configuration management operations, hiding the implementation details.

### Observer Pattern (Implicit)
The configuration system supports dynamic updates, allowing components to react to configuration changes.

### Composite Pattern
Configuration values can be nested, forming a tree-like structure that can be traversed and manipulated as a whole.
