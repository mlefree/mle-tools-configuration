# Technical Context: mle-tools-configuration

## Technologies Used

### Core Technologies
- **TypeScript**: The project is built with TypeScript, providing strong typing and modern JavaScript features
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment for JavaScript/TypeScript execution

### Testing Framework
- **Mocha**: Test framework for running tests
- **Chai**: Assertion library for test validations
- **NYC (Istanbul)**: Code coverage tool to ensure adequate test coverage

### Development Tools
- **TSLint**: Static code analysis tool for TypeScript
- **ts-node**: TypeScript execution engine for Node.js (allows running TypeScript directly)

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v12 or higher recommended)
- npm (v6 or higher recommended)

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mlefree/mle-tools-configuration.git

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test

# Check test coverage
npm run coverage
```

## Technical Constraints

### Compatibility
- The library is designed to work with TypeScript and JavaScript projects
- Compatible with Node.js environments and browser environments
- Supports ES6+ features

### Dependencies
- Minimal external dependencies to reduce potential security issues and maintain a small footprint
- Only one runtime dependency: ts-node

### Performance Considerations
- Configuration operations are designed to be efficient with minimal overhead
- JSON serialization is used for configuration storage, which may impact performance with very large configuration objects
- Deep merging of configuration objects may be CPU-intensive for deeply nested structures

### Security Considerations
- The library does not handle encryption of sensitive configuration values
- Users should implement their own security measures for sensitive configuration data
- No network operations are performed by the library itself
