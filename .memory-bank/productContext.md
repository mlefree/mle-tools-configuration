# Product Context: mle-tools-configuration

## Why This Project Exists
The mle-tools-configuration project was created to address the common challenges developers face when managing configuration in TypeScript/JavaScript applications. Many existing configuration solutions lack type safety, have limited support for dynamic updates, or are overly complex to integrate.

## Problems It Solves
- **Type Safety Issues**: Provides strong typing for configuration values, reducing runtime errors
- **Configuration Fragmentation**: Centralizes configuration management with domain-based organization
- **Runtime Update Challenges**: Enables dynamic configuration updates without application restarts
- **Integration Complexity**: Offers a simple API that integrates easily with existing projects
- **Configuration Accessibility**: Makes configuration values easily accessible throughout the application

## How It Works
The library uses a factory pattern to create and manage configuration instances:

1. **Initialization**: The configuration factory is set up with initial configuration values and domain mappings
2. **Access**: Applications request configuration instances through the factory
3. **Manipulation**: Configuration values can be accessed, modified, or merged at runtime
4. **Organization**: Configuration is organized by domains for logical separation
5. **Storage**: Configuration is stored in memory with JSON serialization capabilities

This approach provides a flexible yet structured way to manage application configuration while maintaining type safety and supporting dynamic updates.
